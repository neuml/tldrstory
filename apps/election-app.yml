    This application categorizes 2020 US Presidential Election Reddit post titles by topic, objectivity and potential bias
    towards a candidate. Data is pulled via the Reddit API using a series of queries for link posts. In most but not all cases,
    the titles of these posts are headlines for news articles.
      
    Reddit post titles are labeled using two categories:
      
      - Objectivity  
      - Bias towards a candidate  
       
    Generally, as the objectivity score increases, the level of bias should decrease.
       
    ### Tech stack
      
    A zero-shot classifier, backed by a large general language model with no labeled data, is used to categorize topics,
    objectivity and potential bias. Additionally, a txtai index enables ad hoc similarity searches against the data.
      
    The following libraries are used:

      - txtai
      - Transformers
      - Sentence Transformers
      - Streamlit
      - FastAPI
